# SQL_Codecademy-assignments
A repository, containing my work on assignments #1, #2 and #3 of Codecademy's "Analyze Data with SQL" skill path.

For each assignment, I have created a report. For a live preview of the code, you can also download each assignment's .sql file, and open it with appropriate database software, e.g. pgAdmin 4.
